The solution focuses on correctly setting up your environment variables.  Ensure you have the following:

1. **ANDROID_HOME** environment variable correctly pointing to your Android SDK directory. 
2. Add the paths to `$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools` and `$ANDROID_HOME/tools` to your system's PATH environment variable.  

Example (Windows):

1. Search for 'environment variables' in Windows Search.
2. Click 'Edit the system environment variables'.
3. Click 'Environment Variables...'
4. Under 'System variables', select 'Path' and click 'Edit...'
5. Add new entries for `%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools` and `%ANDROID_HOME%\tools`.
6. Restart your terminal or command prompt.

After correctly configuring these variables, run `expo prebuild` again. The issue should be resolved.  Properly setting these variables is crucial for Expo to function correctly on Windows with Android projects.
